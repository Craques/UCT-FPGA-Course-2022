# FPGA Master Course &ndash; 2022

This repo contains the course material for the 2022 FPGA course.  The course has been broken into two parts: "FPGA Basics" and "Advanced FPGA Technologies".

## FPGA Basics

EEE5117Z: 27 to 29 April 2022

This course is part 1 of a two part course that aims to cover a complete 
overview of FPGAs. Part 1 of the course aims to introduce the student to the 
basics of FPGA programming.

This includes introducing concepts to ensure the student is able to:

- Understand the underlying physical architecture of FPGAs
- Understand the concept of timing constraints, clock domains and other timing-related issues
- Use the Altera tool-set, including Qsys, JTAG debugging and the general Verilog-based compilation process

## Advanced FPGA Technologies

EEE5118Z: 02 to 04 May 2022

This is a very practical course that provides students with hands on approach 
to FPGAs. This course is part 2 of a two part course that presents the 
principles and techniques fundamental to low-level FPGA firmware
development.  It is biased towards digital signal processing typically
found in Radar, Radio-astronomy and Communication systems.

The course covers a variety of very practical topics, including:

- Design FPGA firmware systems on a high level
- Design FPGA firmware blocks on a low level (i.e. RTL representations of finite state machines and pipelines)
- Implementing FPGA firmware systems
- Debug an FPGA firmware implementation
- Analise timing closure issues and solve the problem such that the final design meets all timing requirements.

It is recommended that EEE5117Z is taken before this course.
