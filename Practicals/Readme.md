# Practicals

This folder contains the practical descriptions for the course.  The intention
is that participants spend time after the course to work on the practicals,
rather than try and finish them all during the course.

This said, the absolute fastest intended schedule is presented below.  The
schedule is limited by the lecture content.

- EEE5117Z:
    - Day 1: Getting Started and Simulation
    - Day 2: UART JTAG and Debugging
    - Day 3: Registers and Data Stream
- EEE5118Z:  
    - Day 4: Arbitration and NCO and DDC
    - Day 5: IIR Filter and Spectrum Analyser
    - Day 6: External FIFO and FIR Filter
