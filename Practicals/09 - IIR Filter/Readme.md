# IIR Filter

- [Algorithm Design](#algorithm-design)
- [Implementation](#implementation)

## Algorithm Design

Design the IIR filter in Matlab / Octave / Python (pay careful attention to 
potential rounding errors and the resolution required).  Assume a sampling 
rate of 44100&nbsp;Sps and design for cut-ff frequencies of 10&nbsp;Hz, 
100&nbsp;Hz, 1&nbsp;kHz and 10&nbsp;kHz.

## Implementation

Implement the filter and verify its functionality by means of simulation.

Then add the filter to the output of the digital down converter in order to
suppress the undesired mixing product.
